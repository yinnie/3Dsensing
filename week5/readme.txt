to get the following examples working:

depthVisualizer_skeleton
ofxOpenNIexample

you need to download this 10 MB zip file:

http://kylemcdonald.net/3dsav/week5-extras.zip

and place the two folders in their respective locations:

of/addons/ofxOpenNI

and then each of the examples needs a copy of the openni folder:

of/3dsav/week5/depthVisualizer_skeleton/bin/data/openni
of/3dsav/week5/ofxOpenNIexample/bin/data/openni
